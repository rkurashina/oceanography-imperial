# CABARET AND ADVECTION MODEL

Contains two programs:

* CABARET is a 3-layer 2D double-gyre, box ocean QG model
* OFFLINE_TRANSPORT advects particles offline using the stream function outputted by CABARET

Instructions are for use on the HPC-cluster

## REQUIREMENTS

* ifort
* netCDF
* fftw

## HOW TO COMPILE

standard_defs.mk contains the compiler options for use on the HPC cluster. Change as necessary
if running on different machine.

* CC is the fortran compiler
* HOME_DIR is the directory in which the code is stored, change as necessary
* CFLAGS lists the compiler flags
* NETCDF_VERSION is the installed version of netcdf, use the recommended version on the HPC
* LIBS lists the location of the fftw and netcdf libraries
* LINKS lists the necessary libraries
* INCLUDES lists the location of the include files

* type module load intel-suite
* type module load netcdf/(version no.)
* To compile cabaret: make -f make_cabaret
* To compile offline_transport: make -f make_advection

## HOW TO RUN ON HPC

* cabaret.pbs is the job script to run the cabaret model. Change the data file names as necessary, and also the save directories. type qsub cabaret.pbs
* advection.pbs is the job script for the advection code. Same as above.

## CODE STRUCTURE

### CABARET

* The main source file is CABARET/qg3netcdf_DG_1025.f
* Edit parameters at the top of the source file.

### ADVECTION

* The main source file is TRANSPORT/offline_transport3layer.f
* Edit INPUT/mod_advection_input.f to change parameters
* Edit offline_transport3layer.f to change seeding locations

### OTHER FOLDERS

* NETCDF contains the subroutines for creating, reading and writing netcdf files
* LAGR contains the methods used for the advection scheme, e.g. spatial interpolation and time integration
* SOLVER contains the elliptic solver used for CABARET
* VAR declares all variables for the main source codes.
